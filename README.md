# Console-Finances

## Overview

This project involves conducting a financial analysis on a dataset representing monthly profits and losses. The dataset is stored in a JavaScript array named `finances`. The analysis covers various metrics such as total months, net total profits/losses, average change in profits/losses, greatest increase in profits, and greatest decrease in profits.

## Dataset

The financial data is structured as an array of arrays, with each sub-array containing two elements: the month-year string and the corresponding profit/loss amount.

```javascript
const finances = [
  ['Jan-2010', 867884],
  // ... (more entries)
  ['Feb-2017', 671099],
];
```

## Analysis Steps

1. **Total Months:**
   - Calculate the total number of months included in the dataset.

2. **Net Total Profits/Losses:**
   - Sum up all the profit/loss amounts to find the net total.

3. **Average Change:**
   - Calculate the average change in profits/losses over the entire period.

4. **Greatest Increase in Profits:**
   - Identify the month with the greatest increase in profits, along with the corresponding amount.

5. **Greatest Decrease in Profits:**
   - Identify the month with the greatest decrease in profits, along with the corresponding amount.

## Implementation Details

The code uses JavaScript and employs various programming concepts and skills, including array manipulation, data analysis, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, and logging output. Each step of the analysis is implemented using for loops and conditional statements to iterate through the dataset.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have a JavaScript environment to run the code.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into your JavaScript environment.
3. Run the script to see the financial analysis results displayed in the console.

## Results

The analysis results, including total months, net total profits/losses, average change, greatest increase, and greatest decrease, will be logged to the console.
